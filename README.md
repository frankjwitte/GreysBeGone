# GreysBeGone

> Because manually selling grey items is beneath you.

**GreysBeGone** is a lightweight World of Warcraft addon that automatically sells all grey-quality (junk) items from your bags whenever you open a vendor, and optionally auto-repairs your gear too. The gold gained (or lost) is printed to the chat frame so you can feel *productive* even though you're just standing next to an NPC.

## 💡 Features

- 🗑️ Auto-sells all grey items on vendor open
- 🔧 Auto-repairs gear if the vendor allows it
- 💬 Chat summary of gold gained from sales and gold spent on repairs
- ⚙️ Optional toggle to disable auto-repair (`/gbg toggle`)
- 🌍 Cross-faction compatible: Works for **Alliance** and **Horde** (*peace through garbage management*)
